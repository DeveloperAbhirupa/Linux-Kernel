# Linux-Kernel
AIM: To design a Linux kernel and implement memory management techniques, interrupt handling and keyboard and mouse device drivers



THEORY:

A kernel is the core component of an operating system. Using interprocess communication and system calls, it acts as a bridge between applications and the data processing performed at the hardware level.When an operating system is loaded into memory, the kernel loads first and remains in memory until the operating system is shut down again. The kernel is responsible for low-level tasks such as disk management, task management and memory management.
